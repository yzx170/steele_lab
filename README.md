## Project 1 - Gait ID
#### Platform: MATLAB
### Publication
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiomech.2022.110953
###### Project Goal
Using kinematic data and kinetic data on the lower limbs (from motion capture, processed through OpenSim 3.3) to cluster novel gait exploration.
###### Input
Matlab data file containg participant inverse kinematic and inverse dynamic data, during both exploration trials and reference trials.
###### Output
Cluster results corresponding to each gait cycle during exploration trials.
###### Methods
Singular value decomposition, Gait feature scores, Time-series clustering
